# BlueFission Automata

The `bluefission/automata` library is a comprehensive PHP framework designed to facilitate the development and deployment of artificial intelligence systems. It combines classical Good Old-Fashioned AI (GOFAI) techniques with modern machine learning methodologies, providing a multifaceted approach to artificial intelligence. This library is suitable for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts looking to explore and implement AI in their projects.

## Features

`bluefission/automata` integrates a wide array of AI and data science techniques into a cohesive library:

- **Expert Systems**: Leverage rule-based logic for decision making, simulating the decision-making ability of human experts.
- **Game Theory**: Analyze competitive environments according to the choices of decision-makers for strategic planning and simulations.
- **Scenario Modeling**: Inspired by NetLogo, it supports agent-based models for simulating interactions and processes within complex systems.
- **Genetic Algorithms**: Implement evolutionary algorithms that mimic natural selection for solving optimization problems.
- **Graph Theory**: Manage, analyze, and manipulate structures represented graphically including networks of nodes and edges.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Tools for text parsing, analysis, and understanding, enabling the library to process and interpret human language.
- **Large Language Models (LLM)**: Facilitate prompting and generating responses using large pre-trained models, integrating with tools like GPT for advanced text generation.
- **Feature Engineering**: Provides robust tools for transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying processes to predictive models.
- **Data Science**: Basic machine learning functionalities alongside data manipulation, preparation, and visualization tools.
- **Input Management**: Sophisticated input type detection and handling, ensuring that data flows seamlessly through processing pipelines.
- **Modular Connectivity**: Connect module outputs to other module inputs, creating flexible and dynamic pipeline chains for complex data processing tasks.

## Using GOFAI and Modern ML Techniques

`bluefission/automata` uniquely integrates both traditional AI methods and modern machine learning techniques to provide a comprehensive toolkit:
- **GOFAI Techniques**: The library utilizes symbolic AI methods for creating systems that reason with logic and predefined rules, suitable for scenarios where decision paths need to be transparent and based on human-like logic.
- **Modern Machine Learning**: Incorporates statistical learning techniques for pattern recognition, predictive modeling, and data-driven decision-making, allowing the system to adapt and learn from data.
