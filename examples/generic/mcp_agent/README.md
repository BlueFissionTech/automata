# MCP Agent Example

Demonstrates how to register an MCP client with the LLM agent, list MCP servers, and send a request through the MCP tool layer. The example uses a stub transport so it runs without a live MCP server.

Run:

```bash
php examples/generic/mcp_agent/run.php
```

What to look for:
- Registered MCP server output
- Echoed request payload from the stub transport
